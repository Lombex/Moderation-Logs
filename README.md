## The mod that shows if a person blocked or muted u

This mod allows u to see who has blocked u or muted u. 
When a person blocks or mutes u outside the instance u are currently in it wont show any results.
The mod only will be able to tell when someone has blocked u or muted u, if that person is inside your current instance.
